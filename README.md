## Installation

The easiest way to install Shease is to clone this repository and use Make to install it to your local user:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/fin-ger/shease.git
$ cd shease
$ PREFIX=~/.local make install
```

As an alternative you can download a pre-packaged tarball from the releases section with `/usr` configured as the installation prefix. Extract this tarball to `/usr` and your good to go!

```
$ cd /usr
$ tar xf /path/to/shease-0.1.0.tgz
```

> Note: The pre-packaged tarball only works with the `/usr` installation prefix. If you prefer a different location, build your own tarball or use the Make installation from above.

## Usage

Shease can be used in 2 different ways: as a sourcable shell script library or as a command-line application.

### Tool

When successfully installed, you can type

```
$ shease --help
```

to get a detailed explanation on what easing functions are available and how to use them.

To launch the demo, run

```
$ shease-demo
```

### Library

You can use all Shease functions by simply sourcing `src/shease.rc`. Look into the source code to find documentation on how to use each function.

## Troubleshooting

If you find any bugs/unexpected behaviour or you have a proposition for future changes open an issue describing the current behaviour and what you expected.

## Development

The development of Shease is centered around the Makefile. The basic workflow consist of applying some changes to the code and running

```
$ make dev-install
$ shease my-command ...
```

to test your changes.

### Creating a Release

A Shease release can be created by running

```
$ make release
```

Follow the instructions to finish the release.
